# Krushmi Madkaikar portfolio

Static portfolio site (plain HTML, CSS and a small script, no build step).

Planned hosting: GitHub Pages project page under user Krushmi, repo `krushmi-portfolio`,
served at https://krushmi.github.io/krushmi-portfolio/

## Publish
1. Create the repo `krushmi-portfolio` under Krushmi and push this folder to the `main` branch.
2. Settings > Pages > Deploy from a branch > `main` / root.

All asset paths are relative (`assets/...`), so the site works under the `/krushmi-portfolio/` subpath and when opened locally.

## Local preview
`python3 -m http.server` in this folder, then open http://localhost:8000/

## Layout
- `index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`
- `assets/` images, profile photo (placeholder), resume PDF
- `screenshots/` desktop and mobile previews
